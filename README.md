## Overview 
This project consist of creating a model to predict the Gross Domestic Product of a region based on the amount of 
electricity used. 
Prediction can be based possibly on a quarterly basis, yearly basis

The steps to create the model
- gather electricity data
- GDP data
- clean data/ analyze the data using pandas library
- create a model looking for correlation/ linear regression 
- test accuracy
- use Tableau, Javascript and HTML to visualize the findings
- html(with drop down menu that shows correlation if there is between electricity used and GDP)

## Challenges
- messy csv file (NAN, notes, data not collected, missing years for comparison) 
- 
## Results
